   some tags and its using 

   <h1> here we write a title (address ) and it will be bold  </h1>

   <p> here we write  a paragraph (any text ) </p>

   <ins> here we put the under lined word </ins>

  <s> here we put the world that will delete </s>
  <del>  here we put the world that will delete </del>  .. the same as <s></s>

<b> to make the word bold </b>
<strong> to make the word bold </strong>

<i> to make the word italic </i>
<em> to make the word italic </em>

<sup> to make the word high in te text </sup>
<sub> > to make the word low in te text </sub>

<mark> to high light a word </mark>

<center > <p> the text here will be in the center of the page </p> </center> 

attributes 

<font color="(the color choose)" size="(the size of word from 1 to 7)" face="(the shape of the word)">here the word that i will do this operation on it</font>

notice : the operation is on the tag before close it ,  attributes here is color and size and face
  
any text between the font will be the condition of attributes

<body align =" the direction of the paragraph (right , left , center)" dir = " direction of written when i write arabic and english (ltr or rtl)">

  any thing written between this body will excute this condition (align , dir )
  <p> the text that i will do this operation to it </p> </body>


  <table border=" the thickness of the border to my table (1) used to make a bord to my table ">

<tr><td> the thing will written in the first row and first coulm</td><td> the thing will written in the first row and second coulm</td></tr>
<tr><td> the thing will written in the second row and first coulm</td><td> the thing will written in the second row and second coulm</td></tr>
<tr><th> the thing will written in the third row and first coulm</th><td> the thing will written in the third row and second coulm</td></tr>

 when we want to make a table we determine the number of coulms and row , inside each row (tr) we write the number of coulms (td) and between td we write the thing will be written in this coulm (we write between coulms only and tr to determine in which row this word will be written) each line has only one tr.
 notice that here we have 3 rows and 2 coulms .
 notice in the first coulm and third low we use (th instead of td thats mean that the thing written here is bold)
